Built as part of a project in The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router) by Colt Steele on Udemy

The original project was written using class components. I decided to write it myself using functional components because it was more fitting of modern react code and because newer Material UI and React Router required using functional components. As such, much of this project required original solutions and figuring out how to refactor things differently from the original code.
